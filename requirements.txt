🔹 LEVEL 1: Baseline Model (Transfer Learning)
Approach Taken

A baseline image classifier was built using transfer learning with a pretrained ResNet-50 model. The pretrained backbone was used to leverage rich visual features learned from ImageNet, while the final classification layer was adapted for CIFAR-10.

Model Architecture & Reasoning
1. Backbone: ResNet-50 (pretrained)
Modified final fully connected layer → 10 output classes
Earlier layers frozen initially to stabilize training
Fine-tuning applied in later epochs

Reasoning:
Transfer learning significantly reduces training time and improves generalization on small-resolution datasets like CIFAR-10.

Key Design Decisions:
1.Used pretrained weights to accelerate convergence
2. Resized CIFAR-10 images to match ResNet input
3. Adam optimizer with moderate learning rate
4. Cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification

Observed Failure Cases / Limitations
1. Confusion between visually similar classes (e.g., Cat vs Dog)
2. Limited adaptation to small image resolution

🔹 LEVEL 2: Intermediate Techniques
Approach Taken
Performance was improved using data augmentation, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning while retaining the baseline architecture.

Model Architecture & Reasoning
Same backbone (ResNet-50)
Training pipeline enhanced with augmentation
Regularization added to improve generalization
Key Design Decisions

Data Augmentation:
1.Random crop
2.Horizontal flip
3.Normalization
4.Regularization:
5. Dropout

Weight decay
1.Learning rate tuning and scheduler usage
2.Conducted ablation study (with vs without augmentation)
3.Observed Failure Cases / Limitations
4.Diminishing returns after extensive augmentation
5.Slight instability with high learning rates
6.Some classes still underperform due to limited resolution

🔹 LEVEL 3: Advanced Architecture Design
Approach Taken
A custom CNN architecture was designed, incorporating attention mechanisms to focus on discriminative regions in images.

Model Architecture & Reasoning
1.Custom multi-block CNN
2.Channel attention module (SE / CBAM-style)
3.Adaptive pooling for resolution robustness
4.Improved feature extraction for fine-grained classes

Reasoning:
Custom architectures allow better control over feature learning for small images compared to large pretrained models.

Key Design Decisions
1.Attention to enhance important feature channels
2.Adaptive Average Pooling to avoid shape mismatch
3.Per-class performance evaluation
4.Grad-CAM used for interpretability

Observed Failure Cases / Limitations
1.Higher training time compared to baseline
2.Attention sometimes amplifies background noise
3.Requires careful hyperparameter tuning

🔹 LEVEL 4: Expert Techniques (Shortlist Threshold)
Approach Taken
An ensemble learning strategy was implemented by combining predictions from multiple high-performing models to improve robustness and accuracy.

Model Architecture & Reasoning
Ensemble of:

Transfer learning model
Custom CNN
Attention-based model
Final prediction via soft voting

Reasoning:
Ensembles reduce variance and compensate for individual model weaknesses.

Key Design Decisions
1.Trained multiple independent models
2.Implemented voting-based ensemble strategy
3.Comparative evaluation against single models
4.Detailed experimental documentation

Observed Failure Cases / Limitations
1.Increased computational and memory cost
2.Longer training and inference time
3.More complex pipeline to maintain
4.Slight overfitting without augmentation
