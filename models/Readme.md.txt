# Trained Models

Due to GitHub file size limitations, trained model weight files (.pth) are not uploaded.

All models are generated dynamically by running the corresponding
Level-wise Google Colab notebooks:

- Level1.ipynb → 
- Level2.ipynb → https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SGw96OxxcLhKfvxllA4AKFo8RH49bbqC?usp=sharing
- Level3.ipynb → 
- Level4.ipynb → https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12-LbKhmL7SYjYeTtdz1QNRp4FEyBwoHD?usp=sharing

Each notebook contains code to save the best-performing model
using torch.save(model.state_dict(), path).

Hardware: Google Colab GPU
Framework: PyTorch
