# Trained Models

Due to GitHub file size limitations, trained model weight files (.pth) are not uploaded.

All models are generated dynamically by running the corresponding
Level-wise Google Colab notebooks:

### Google Colab Notebooks

- Level 1 – Baseline Model  
  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MBBx5bhc4_OFgHj7oVW5FCNlD-yiSq46

- Level 2 – Intermediate Techniques  
  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SGw96OxxcLhKfvxllA4AKFo8RH49bbqC

- Level 3 – Advanced Architecture  
  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UG9xYBAA8Emy6Ua-tIKWEvMKGmCLvzEi

- Level 4 – Ensemble Expert Techniques  
  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12-LbKhmL7SYjYeTtdz1QNRp4FEyBwoHD


Each notebook contains code to save the best-performing model
using torch.save(model.state_dict(), path).

Hardware: Google Colab GPU
Framework: PyTorch
